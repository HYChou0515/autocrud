        ``add_model`` puts every Vector field into ``indexed_fields`` on purpose:
        brute-force backends have no vector column and answer similarity straight
        out of ``indexed_data``, and we ourselves read that copy on the way in (see
        ``_extract_vec_value``, called from ``_meta_row_values`` BEFORE this — off
        the in-memory meta, so the column is populated either way).

        On this backend the copy has no reader once the column is written:
        ``_build_vector_condition`` and ``_build_vector_order`` both query
        ``_vec_col_name(...)``, and ``iter_search`` returns metas by decoding the
        ``data`` BYTEA — which still holds the whole ResourceMeta, vector included.
        So nothing observable changes; what goes away is dead weight, and it is not
        the cheap kind. The GIN over ``indexed_data`` indexes every ELEMENT of the
        array, so one 4096-dim embedding costs 4096 index entries per row, and
        every ``@>`` probe rechecks against the fat jsonb. Measured on 5000 rows
        carrying a 4096-dim embedding, against the same rows without it:

            GIN size          43 MB   ->   312 kB     (138x)
            total relation   280 MB   ->   840 kB     (333x)
            @> probe        490.8 ms  ->   1.2 ms     (400x)

        That is what made a real deployment's document list take 15 seconds. The
        bloat predates the #416 rewrite, but nothing USED the GIN while ``->>``
        forced a Seq Scan, so #416 is what woke it up.

        Only a REGISTERED column licenses the strip: ``_vec_columns`` is empty
        unless ``ensure_vector_column`` ran, and without a column ``indexed_data``
        is the only queryable surface left, so the copy stays.

        This strips the JSONB column only, NOT the BYTEA — which is exactly why
        readers cannot tell, and equally why the storage is not reclaimed. Doing
        that changes what readers see and is a separate decision.
